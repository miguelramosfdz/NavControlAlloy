Cross platform (ios,android) navigation controller for Appcelerator Titanium Alloy 3.2.0.GA
(updated to accomodate Ti.UI.iOS.createNavigationWindow)
1/15/14 - made the commonjs implementation into an alloy widget.

add the following to your config.json

"dependencies": {
        "com.n3wc.navcontrolleralloy": "1.0"
    }

then to create a new nav controller:
var NavigationController = Alloy.createWidget("com.n3wc.navcontrolleralloy",{logging:true});
Alloy.Globals.navcontroller = NavigationController.navController;

use it to open a new window:
var testwin = Alloy.createController('TestWindow').getView();
Alloy.Globals.navcontroller.open(testwin);


methods:
//open a new window
open(/*Ti.UI.Window*/windowToOpen,/*bool*/HideNavBar);

//close current window
close();

//go back to the initial window of the NavigationController
home();

//go back to the initial window of the NavigationController then open a new window
openFromHome(/*Ti.UI.Window*/windowToOpen,/*bool*/HideNavBar);

project forked from https://github.com/vuinguyen/NavControlAlloy
Made it a widget and updated it to support 3.2.0.GA & changes for Ti.UI.iOS.createNavigationWindow
Extended open method to support suppressing default navigation bar as well as added a close method to dispose of current window in the stack
